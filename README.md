PROPOSED SOLUTION 

All these crimes involve in a very longer process to reach police and get actioned, hence we are proposing a solution to make the process faster and easier for the public by developing a mobile application called “CRIME PATROL APP”. One can report the crime on the spot and help the police to take the action in a faster way.

INTRODUCTION TO CRIME PATROL 

The Crime Patrol app is a Reporting System that allows user to quickly and efficiently submit an official police report for certain crimes or occurrences, in hassle free manner. When a user completes this report (incident report) (and after it is reviewed and approved by a police officer), it can be seen into the app under My Complaints section. The crimes reported online couldn’t involve a known suspect.

User has to agree to the terms and conditions for app usage at the time of registration. (More details can be seen under Terms and conditions section)
Some of the important features that are incorporated in the app, that make CRIME PATROL a unique and more efficient solution for the biggest issue of our society are as follows: -
•	User can log complaint in minimum number of Taps
CRIME PATROL app has some predefined crimes categories and sub-categories that user can select and lodge a complaint or raise an incident in minimum number of taps.
•	It automatically detects the location of user and send it to server while submitting incident
App automatically detects the lat-long location of the user while creating an incident and sends it to the server while submission. It will help the police staff to locate the actual crime scene (in most of the cases where user actually reported crime from crime scene.). It also helps the respective department to provide user immediate help in case of emergency (accident etc.). Location tracking will also help to locate and report incident to nearest police stations (or other service providers).
•	It allows user to take pictures and video of the incident and upload it as evidence
App allows user to take evidences like pictures and video at the crime scene if possible and upload it to server, which can help the local authorities to track criminals and take immediate actions against them.
•	It allows user to view all its complaints and their status respectively
Once the complaint / incident is verified by the police and local authorities, it can be viewed under my complaint section of the app. User can check the current status of his complaint.
•	User can see the crime report area/city wise
App provides the graphical representation of the crimes happening around the user (based on current location). It also provides map view to see crimes happening city/ locality wise.
•	There are emergency options available
There are few options available in case of emergency. For any serious crime user and directly call police station in one tap.  One tap option is available for other emergencies like medical and fire.
